ndn-signed-data: a simple example to show signed data
=================================================================================

These are some simple examples of how to program signed data.

1. Producer/consumer: consumer requests data, producer provides signed data using a 
   self-signed certificate. When consumer gets data, it checks the signature by using 
   a file that contains a self-signed certificate.

   Validation process at consumer:

2. Producer/consumer: consumer requests data, producer provides signed data using
   a second party signed certificate. When consumer gets data, it requests the 
   second party signed certificate to validate the data which will be also provided by
   producer.

3. Producer/consumer: consumer requests data, producer provides signed data using
   hierarchical certificate model, similar to NDN testbed model.
