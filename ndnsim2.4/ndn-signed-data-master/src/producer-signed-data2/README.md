producer-signed-data2 example
=============================


- This example is the same producer as producer-signed-data1 
  which filters `/example/test` interests. 
  It provides Data named `<InterestPrefix>/testApp` signed by 
  an identity. 
  The identity is a command line program argument, for instance 
  `/ndn/keys/bob`. In this case, data sent by this producer should
  be as following:

             +--------------------------------------------------------+
             |Name: <InterestPrefix>/testApp/<version>                |
             +--------------------------------------------------------+
             |ContentType: 0 (blob)                                   |
             +--------------------------------------------------------+
             |Freshness period: 10000 msec                            |
             +--------------------------------------------------------+
             |Content: <string>                                       |
             +--------------------------------------------------------+
             |SignatureType: 1 (rsa-256)                              |
             +--------------------------------------------------------+
             |KeyLocator: /ndn/keys/bob/KEY/ksk-<number>/ID-CERT      |
             +--------------------------------------------------------+
             |SignatureValue: <signature_256_bits>                    |
             +--------------------------------------------------------+

   It is not always feasible for a consumer to have a priori knowledge
   about the signing key of all the received data packets.  In this
   case, a consumer needs to retrieve the public key bits of a signing
   key according to the key-locator information specified in a data
   packet.  For this reason, this producer filters `/ndn/keys`
   interests to provide certificates with name prefix `/ndn/keys`. It
   retrieves them from the keyChain stored in disk. This is very
   useful when using no auto-signed certificates.


- Build this example

    From `ndn-signed-data/` folder run `./waf configure`and  `./waf`. 

- Run this example

  **PROVIDER**

    For instance, the provider could use `/ndn/keys/bob` identity to
    sign data.  This identity could be a certificate signed by another
    identity, `/ndn/keys/alice`.  Alice's certificate is saved in a
    file at the consumer side as a trust anchor. Upon receiving a data
    packet signed by Bob, the consumer will send an interest to
    retrieve Bob's certificate, that is also produced by the provider.

    Before running provider, it is required to create certificates to
    sign data.  For instance, the following commands can be run from
    the `ndn-signed-data/` folder in order to create these
    certificates and install/store them in the keychain:

        $ ndnsec-key-gen -n /ndn/keys/bob > bob-unsigned.cert
        $ ndnsec-cert-install bob-unsigned.cert
 
    Sign Bob's public key (stored in the previous unsigned
    certificate) with `/ndn/keys/alice` (this identity should already
    exist in the keychain if you have run the producer-signed-data1
    before):

        $ ndnsec-cert-gen –s /ndn/keys/alice –N "Bob" –r bob-unsigned.cert > bob.cert
        $ ndnsec-cert-install bob.cert

    Check if Bob's certificate is effectively signed by Alice:

        $ ndnsec-dump-certificate -p -i /ndn/keys/bob

    Run this example from `ndn-signed-data/` folder using the previous
    identity:

        $ ./build/bin/producer-signed-data2/producer-signed-data2 /ndn/keys/bob

    Whenever an interest with this prefix `/example/test` is received, 
    the producer returns a `<InterestPrefix>/testApp` signed data by 
    the identity `/ndn/keys/bob`. And whenever an interest with prefix `/ndn/keys`
    is received, if the certificate of that identity exists in the keyChain, the 
    producer returns it in a Data packet.

  **CONSUMER**

    Run the consumer from `ndn-signed-data/` folder using the provider-signed-data1 
    and the validation rules in `./config/validation2.conf`:

      rule
      {
        id "Example Validator"
        for data
        filter
        {
          type name
          name /example
          relation is-prefix-of
        }
        checker
        {
          type customized
          sig-type rsa-sha256
          key-locator
          {
            type name
            name /ndn/keys/bob
            relation is-prefix-of
          }
        }
      }

      rule
      {
        id "Example2 Validator"
        for data
        filter
        {
          type name
          name /ndn/keys/bob
          relation is-prefix-of
        }
        checker
        {
          type customized
          sig-type rsa-sha256
          key-locator
          {
            type name
            name /ndn/keys/alice
            relation is-prefix-of
          }
        }
      }

      trust-anchor
      {
        type file
        file-name "./config/trust.cert"
      }



    Run this example from `ndn-signed-data/` folder:

        ./build/bin/consumer-signed-data1/consumer-signed-data1 ./config/validation2.conf
